# pyqt-simple-page

A simple example of a page created with PyQt5.

## What it contains?
This repo contains sample codes of the [PyQt5 library](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/), with the only purpose of making the user understand how to use it and the potential of this library.
So we want to share simple or advanced codes explained in a simple and synthetic way, with the use of comments.

We accept sharing and collaboration, as well as criticism in terms of style and type of script writing.
